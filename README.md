# UAS Munich Vehicle Dynamics Project 2018

This project was the final project of the Vehicle Dynamics course at the University of Applied Sciences Munich in 2018. My assigned project partners were Frederik Markus and Prashant Dhabaliya.

The purpose of this project is the analysis of an implemented Simulink model of a Lane Keeping Assist System and its effect to the lateral jerk as Key Performance Indicator (KPI). At first, a symmetric S-curve as well as a specific scenario will be defined. Furthermore, the effect of the Lane Keeping Assist System to the carâ€™s lateral jerk will be analyzed by varying typical vehicle, road and camera parameters and evaluating the resulting signals using different analysis methods. In detail, the simulation data will be analyzed with regard to their frequency distribution as well as their temporal and vibration behavior.

**(1)** First, a route is created taking into account the legal requirements and the physical boundary conditions. In this work, the creation of an S-curve with an alternating angle of inclination is described. 

**(2)** The next step is the definition of the vehicle and camera parameters as well as the maneuver. 

**(3)** The simulation is then carried out, the output of which generates the lateral jerk signal. 

**(4)** In order to determine the influence of individual parameters on the lateral jerk, this process is repeated for each variation. 

**(5)** Simulation data are evaluated with regard to their frequency distribution, their temporal course and their vibration behavior.

**(6)** The results are presented in the form of histograms, "spider web plots" and raw signals for each variation.
